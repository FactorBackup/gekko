# Gekko "Indicator" + "Quasar UI" Fork

This is a fork that is able to display indicator-results (native, tulip, talib) in charts @ the Gekko backtest page.
Basically it's simply my gekko-quasar-ui project and a pimped version of gekko with a few fixes that can send Indicator results via http-request.

It's still buggy as hell but hopefully it's useful despite that fact. ;)

If you like this, please feel free to tip @ 191hR9AftcrGH2Vb29ogPBoUjFowsvAMrk (BTC) ...

The VueJS-UI (based on Quasar UI Framework) project for this can be obtained here: [Gekko trading bot fork](https://github.com/h256/gekko-quasar-ui)
